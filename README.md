Graphy is a Java based library that implements the concepts defined in Graph Theory.  At the moment, this library is not in a production ready mode and is currently still under development.  Despite being under development, you can download the library and play around with the Undirected and Directed Graph classes.  These have been tested and are known to work as described in Graph Theory, but have not been proven to be optimized and fully stable for production.
